    <h2>Roots of the Company</h2>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="text-div">
            <p>George Raymond Sr. founded the Raymond Corporation in 1922.</p>
            <p>The company was located in the village of Greene, meaning it was close
                to the Chenango River and the railroad, which were both important for transportation of goods at
                the time.</p>
            <p>Over the years, the company has expanded to where it is today.</p>
