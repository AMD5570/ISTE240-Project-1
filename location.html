                        <p>Greene is located in Chenango County in the Southern Tier of New York State. Some of the closest cities would include Binghamton to the south,
                            Syracuse to the northwest, and Utica to the northeast. The town is easily accessible via several highways, including NY-12 and NY-206. The town also sits
                            between two major interstates, I-81 to the west and I-88 to the east.</p>

                        <p>Greene sits between many rolling hills and valleys. This is common with many towns in the Southern Tier region of New York.</p>
                        <p>The Chenango River runs through the town, providing access to boating and fishing opportunities.</p>
                        <p>Greene is only about 25 minutes from the Pennsylvania border, meaning it's a great spot for those looking to explore both New York and 
                            parts of northern Pennsylvania, like Scranton.</p>
