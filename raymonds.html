                    <p>The Raymond Corporation, which has locations all over the country but began in Greene, is a
                        manufacturer that specializes in creating
                        industrial equipment such as forklifts and pallet jacks.
                    </p>
                    <p>The company has played a significant role in the local economy and has been a main employer in
                        the Greene area for many years.</p>
                    <p>The company, which actually hires from RIT specifically, often participates in job fairs and
                        looks for students majoring in
                        engineering and other technology fields.</p>

                    <p>George Raymond Sr. founded the Raymond Corporation in 1922.</p>
                    <p>The company was located in the village of Greene, meaning it was close
                        to the Chenango River and the railroad, which were both important for transportation of goods at
                        the time.</p>
                    <p>Over the years, the company has expanded to where it is today.</p>
